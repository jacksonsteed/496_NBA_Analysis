Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

Open up the files

```{r}
library(readr)
# Specify the file path to your CSV file, change path as needed

# Print the first few rows of the dataframe to check the data
#head(games_data)
#head(games_details_data)

Find any duplicates and errors in the data

```{r}

Left join to get the date column

Create new columns for the last game they played and how many minutes they played
